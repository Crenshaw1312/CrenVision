# Crenvision
It's my preset with a little too much code for my ClearVision Preset
_ _
## Adding CrenVision
Add the link below, or replace your ClearVision link, with the one below.
```
@import url(https://Crenshaw1312.github.io/CrenVision/main.css);
```
Look in the main.css file above for the new vars you can use!

## Questions
### Do I lose any ClearVision function?
no you don't! All the edits and tweaks are add-ons, you only gain!

### Why no default pictures?
There's too many customizable options to really showcase it like that, so instead I made a bunch of different styles you can switch between, or customize your own.

### Can I add my style?
Of course! just make a PR or DM Crenshaw#1312.

### Where can I find more wallpapers?
You can join my server, or explore reddit!
