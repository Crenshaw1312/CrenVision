# Crenvision
It's my preset with a little too much code for my ClearVision Preset
_ _
## Adding CrenVision
Some random words to really fucking sell my preset.
### I already have ClearVision
Replace your clearvsion import line with the one below.
```
@import url(https://Crenshaw1312.github.io/CrenVision/main.css);
```
Look in the main.css file above for the new vars you can use!
> You should lighten your main color to be partially transparnet
 
### I'm brand new!
Well this theme is pretty heavy with it's options, but if you're confident, terminal, or command prompt, and run the following:
```
cd powercord/src/powercord/themes
git clone https://github.com/Crenshaw1312/Crenvision
```
Then open up the main.scss file in a text editor and remove `//` infront of styles that sound appealing to you!

### I'm on BetterDiscord!
*cough* use *cough cough* powercord, anyways though this theme isn't BetterDiscord friendly **YET**
> if you really want it DM me and I'll send you a a file that you can use for BetterDiscord


## Questions
### Do I lose any ClearVision function?
no you don't! All the edits and tweaks are add-ons, you only gain!

### Why no default pictures?
There's too many customizable options to really showcase it like that, so instead I made a bunch of different styles you can switch between, or customize your own.

### Can I add my style?
Of course! just make a PR or DM Crenshaw#1312.

### Where can I find more wallpapers?
You can join my server, or explore reddit!

### I want to share my version!
FUCK YEA! just DM me the file that has the root, and whatever shit you wanna add, or make a PR, I'll get it added, or updated every time you send it!
>I'm not responsible if you're using one of these tho and it looks like shit
