# Crenvision
It's my preset with a little too much code for a ClearVision preset
_ _
## Adding CrenVision
Some random words to really fucking sell my preset.
### I already have ClearVision
Replace your clearvsion import line with the one below.
```
@import url(https://Crenshaw1312.github.io/CrenVision/main.css);
```
Look in the main.css file above for the new vars you can use!
> You should lighten your main color to be partially transparnet
 
### I'm brand new!
> step one: fucking get powercord scrub

Well this theme is pretty heavy with it's options, but if you're confident, terminal, or command prompt, and run the following:
```
cd powercord/src/powercord/themes
git clone https://github.com/Crenshaw1312/Crenvision
```
Then open up the CrenVision.scss file in a text editor and remove `//` infront of styles that sound appealing to you!

### I'm on BetterDiscord or GooseMod!
*cough* use *cough cough* powercord, anyways though just use one of the files in Styles, or import it into your custom css like:
`@import url(https://Crenshaw1312.github.io/CrenVision/Styles/YOSHINO);` and just change YOSHINO to the style you want.
> NOTE (GOOSEMOD USERS): chat messages are minimally broken do to the fact you can't get all the needed data attributes from BDFDB on GooseMOD


## Questions
### I installed and there's no changes
Go to you files and find CrenVision. Open CrenVision.scss and remove `//` or add them back, as wanted.
### Do I lose any ClearVision function?
no you don't! All the edits and tweaks are add-ons, you only gain!

### Why no default pictures?
There's too many customizable options to really showcase it like that, so instead I made a bunch of different styles you can switch between, or customize your own.

### Where can I find more wallpapers?
You can join my server, or explore reddit!

### I want to share my version!
FUCK YEA! just DM me the file that has the root, and whatever shit you wanna add, or make a PR, I'll get it added, or updated every time you send it!
>I'm not responsible if you're using one of these tho and it looks like shit
